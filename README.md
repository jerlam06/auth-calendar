Web application with authentification, profile and calendar features generated using <a target="_blank" href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>. Built with React.js, Typescript and SCSS.
It took me a whole day to build this application.

## Run Locally

```bash
  npm i
  npm run dev
```

## Documentation

The mock API is using <a target="_blank" href="https://dummyjson.com/">dummyJSON</a> for JWT-based authentication. Even though the authentication/authorization process is fully functionnal, no data can be written to the server since it is a mock server. The following user can be used to authenticate:

```bash
  User: atuny0
  Password: 9uQFF1Lh
```
